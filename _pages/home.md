I'm a Ph.D. student in the [*Network Security Group (NetSec)*](https://netsec.ethz.ch) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch), supervised by Professor [Adrian Perrig](https://netsec.ethz.ch/people/aperrig/).
Before joining *NetSec*, I received my *M.Sc in Computer Science* from [*National Taiwan University*](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english), where I studied cybersecurity at the [*Network Security Lab*](https://nslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw) under the supervision of Professor [Hsu-Chun Hsiao](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hchsiao/).

I'm interested in group key agreement protocols, anonymous communication, and quantum resilience.
