I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science, expected to start in June 2025.
Before that, I received my M.Sc (2024) and B.Sc (2022) degrees in Computer Science from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english), where I studied cybersecurity at the [Network Security Lab](https://nslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw) under the supervision of Professor [Hsu-Chun Hsiao](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~hchsiao/).

I am interested in applied cryptography in networking protocols, with a focus on key agreement protocols used in secure messaging protocols, and other cryptos used for anonymous communication.
