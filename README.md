# Personal Website

The website is based on [Leonid Keselman](https://leonidk.com)'s [Jekyll fork](https://github.com/leonidk/new_website) of [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/). 
I refactored the design based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme, which uses the plugin [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) to display publications. 
I tweaked the style of the bibliography, so it looks different from the original website.

Feel free to use the template for your own purposes, but please respect copyright for all images/content under the `assets/img`, `assets/pdf`, `_posts` folders. 

## How to use

Most settings can be found and modified in the `_config.yml` configuration file. You can update the bio by editing `_pages/home.md` and manage the list of publications in `_bibliography/papers.bib`. The avatar image is located at `assets/img/me.jpg` with a recommended size of 280x280 pixels.
